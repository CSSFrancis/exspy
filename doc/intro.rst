What is exSpy
=============

exSpy is an open source Python library which provides tools to facilitate
the visualization and processing of EELS EDS and other spectroscopic data.

exSpy is built on top of HyperSpy, a Python library for multi-dimensional
data analysis and extends it with tools for the analysis of spectroscopic data.
